We need two capabilities to run these pipelines: R and local Blast. For R, please install R at its website (https://www.r-project.org/), and R studio desktop (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/). Both are free. For Blast, I strongly recommend local Blast as this is way faster than NCBI server - depending on server traffic and input sequence length, it takes about 1-10min for each Blast on its server. In comparison, we can do 3-10 Blasts per second locally. As we'll be doing a lot of Blasts, please make sure to have your own Blast setup. 

For demonstration purposes, this would be the steps to setup local virome Blast at Dylanâ€™s computer and put the database on my desktop. Please feel free to change the folder directory as you wish.

Steps to setup local virome Blast:
1. Download and install NCBI local Blast machine. For my laptop it would be ncbi-blast-2.12.0+-win64.exe. After installation, restart computer. Download Link: https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/

2. Download NCBI viral genomes. Link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/viruses/
   2.1 Download "Accession list of all viral genomes".
   2.2 Download all the fna files of refseq virus genomes (viral.1.1.genomic.fna.gz, viral.2.1.genomic.fna.gz, viral.3.1.genomic.fna.gz). First decompress the gz file (I use 7z to decompress), and open the respective folder, you should see a fna file (similar to fasta) if you open with notepad. Do all three, and combine all three fna files into one file. You can easily copy & paste everything in the 2nd file into the bottom of the first file, and repeat by doing the 3rd file to the bottom of the combined 1st and 2nd file. 
   
3. Open command prompt and make local database. 
   3.1 Type "cmd" at the windows search bar and open.
   3.2 For demonstration purpose, the file at 2.1 is saved as "c:/users/dylan/desktop/taxid10239.nbr", and the combined file of three fna at the end of 2.2 is saved as "c:/users/dylan/desktop/virome.fna", and we are making the virome Blast database at the desktop with the name "virome1", which directory would be "c:/users/dylan/desktop/BlastDB/virome1". Again, please change your directory accordingly based on the folder you're putting it into. 
   3.1 Copy and past the below code
   -----------------------------------------
   makeblastdb -in "c:/users/dylan/desktop/virome.fna" -taxid_map "c:/users/dylan/desktop/taxid10239.nbr" -dbtype nucl  -parse_seqids -out "c:/users/dylan/desktop/BlastDB/virome1"
   -----------------------------------------
   then a folder named "BlastDB" should appear on your target folder, or in this case, Dylan's desktop.
   
4. Test if your local virome Blast machine works
   4.1 Make a sample viral sequence as an input. The easiest way is to just copy a partial sequence from a random genome. For instance, open the viral.1.1.genomic.fna, and copy & paste the first virus, ">NC_001798.2 Human herpesvirus 2 strain HG52, complete genome", and the copy a partial nucleotide sequence at the next line, and save as a .txt file. For instance, save it as "c:/users/dylan/desktop/text.txt" (again, make your own directory accordingly).
   4.2 Open command prompt, and execute the below code. Note change the file directory after -query, and virome Blast database after -db accordingly.
   -----------------------------------------------------
   blastn -query "c:/users/dylan/desktop/text.txt" -db "c:/users/dylan/desktop/BlastDB/virome1" -reward 2 -penalty -3 -gapopen 5 -gapextend 2 -word_size 11 -outfmt 10 -evalue 1e-10
   ------------------------------------------------------
   4.3 At least one result should show up and telling that the query sequence matched the Human Herpesvirus 2 sequence - since we made it as a partial sequence of its genome.

5. Create these folders for storing documents (these are to be used in the R function later; if you change the directory here, please change it in the function as well). Before each new analysis, please make sure to empty these folders.
   5.1 C:/RNAs                # This is to independently store RNA files from input fasta. 
   5.2 C:/RCRNAs              # This stores the reverse transcribed RNA sequenceses from input fasta for MILL pipeline.
   5.3 C:/Blastout            # This stores the Blast results for both MILL and Virome blast pipeline (only one pipeline can run at a time, again plz make sure to empty the folder before any new anlysis)
   5.4 C:/Taxonomy            # This stores the taxonomy results of positive hits from Virome blast pipeline.
   5.5 C:/Finalresult         # This stores the final result of MILL pipeline by generating all MILL hits into one fasta file, based on the input threshold of dsRNA length and percentage identity.
   
Viola! Now you have both the local Virome Blast machine and R installed. These are basically all we need to execute the two pipelines. If you want to play with other local blast databases, simply redo step 3 but switch the virus genomes with whatever sequences you want. For instance, bacteria 16s rRNA for "bacteriome", or a collection of known pathogen genomes as "infectome". Endless possibilities!
