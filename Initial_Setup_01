We need two capabilities to run these pipelines: R and local Blast. For R, please install R at its website (https://www.r-project.org/), and R studio desktop (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/). Both are free. For Blast, I strongly recommend local Blast as this is way faster than NCBI server - depending on server traffic and input sequence length, it takes about 1-10min for each Blast on its server. In comparison, we can do 3-10 Blasts per second locally. As we'll be doing a lot of Blasts, please make sure to have your own Blast setup. 

For demonstration purposes, this would be the steps to setup local Blast at Dylanâ€™s computer and put the database on my desktop. Please feel free to change the folder directory as you wish.
